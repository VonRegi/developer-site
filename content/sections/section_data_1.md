### About Me

Thomas Budds is a Melbourne based, IT Steam Lead in M&A and DevOps/SRE.

I currently work at [Telstra Purple](https://purple.telstra.com.au) (formerly Readify) in Merges & Acquisitions.

I have worked on some major acquisitions for Telstra including Epicon ($25M), Aqura Technologies ($40M), Alliance Automation ($40M) and Versent ($267M).

I am fascinated by automation and all things integration!
